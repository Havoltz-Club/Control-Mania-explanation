## Introduction

Now, since we know some fundamentals, let's try out what we can do in **MATLAB** and **Simulink**.

## Why MATLAB?

We use **MATLAB** and **Simulink** because these are the industry standards, but we will also be showing how to solve these codes in different software.

## Topics Covered

- **MATLAB syntax**  
- **Basic plotting code** → also discrete functions  
- **Basic matrix operations**  
- **Basic differential equations**  
- **Simulink example** → position and ball  
- **Laplace transforms in MATLAB**
